# Smart Environment Monitoring System

## Overview:
This project is a multi-sensor embedded system developed using Arduino to monitor environmental conditions such as distance and temperature. The system provides real-time feedback through an LCD display and triggers alerts using an LED and buzzer when unsafe conditions are detected.

## Features:
- Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor
- Temperature monitoring using LM35
- Real-time LCD display
- Audio and visual alerts
- Integrated sensor architecture

## Hardware Used:
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- 16x2 I2C LCD
- LED
- Buzzer

## Learning Outcomes:
- Embedded system design
- Sensor interfacing
- Analog-to-digital conversion
- Real-time monitoring

## Future Improvements:
- IoT-based monitoring
- Mobile alerts
- Cloud data logging
